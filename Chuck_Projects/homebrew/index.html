<h1 style="text-align: center;">220b HW2: Homebrew-Final</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Joudi Nox</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">I felt like my homebrew needed to start rhythmic only because that's how my day and brain sound like on daily basis. Checking boxes of things that make me feel good throughout the day; Songwriting, video chatting with loved ones, drinking tea, listening to music, and going to cafes. But my day is also interrupted by anxiety attacks and annoying construction sounds or leaf blower sounds in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The everyday life of a songwriter consists of a lot of little details that make the writing process smoother. For me it's my mornings and my tea. So I start my day writing songs, drinking tea, playing my guitar. Then I listen to Fayrouz. She's a Lebanese folk singer. It's a tradition and a daily habit to listen to her music while having morning coffee or tea.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love going to cafes so I'm always there working, people watching and just enjoying my own company. And for the past two years it's been a daily to have a little anxiety attack, hence the heavy breathing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I wanted something rhythmic, because that's how I perceive my daily routine. I write down what I need to do and recite it in a rhythmic pattern. So I assigned each audio sample to a beat (from 0 to 7: 8 beat positions). I wanted to start with the heavy breathing but for some reason MiniAudicle wasn't letting me (work in progress to troubleshoot this before the final presentation). Thus, I added the heavy breathes in the end along the crowded cafe atmosphere. I panned the book pages to the right and the tea water pouring to the left to give the listener the sense that they're with me surrounded by these sounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I added the hum sound to emulate the interior design constructions sounds or leaf blower or whatever work that are happening in the apartment next door or downstairs.&nbsp;</p>
